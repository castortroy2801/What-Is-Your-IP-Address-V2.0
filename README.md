What Is My IP - Python CGI Script
================

### Overview

This is a script site that displays the public IP address as the many similar sites to **"What's Your IP Address?"** with a geo map and many customizable options that are in the file ~/config/conf.ini
The configuration file for Apache CGI is also provided.


### How to use this

* You simply put all the files in that folder in the public directory of your server.
* You may need to change the permissions of the file to be executed (_index.py_).
* This can easily do this with your FTP client or via SSH access with the command: `sudo chmod +x index.py`
* You must also edit the file ~/config/conf.ini that includes the information on your site (url, name, contact_email and analytics_id).
